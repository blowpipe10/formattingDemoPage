        <h1>Formatting Demo Page</h1>
        <p>This simple page demonstrates the formatting tags covered in this lesson.</p>
        <h2>Bold and Strong</h2>
        <b>This is bold text.</b>
        <p>The strong tag has the same visual effect as the bold tag but the strong tag also marks the enclosed
            text as more important. It is also easier for screen readers to read for the visually disabled.</p>
        <strong>This is what strong text looks like.</strong>
        <h2>Italic and Emphasis</h2>
        <i>This text is in italics</i>
        <p>The emphasis tag has the same visual effect as the italic tag but the emphasis tag also marks the 
            enclosed text as more important. It is also easier for screen readers to read.</p>
        <em>This is what emphasized text looks like.</em>
        <h2>Subscript and Subscript</h2>
        <p>Subscript text looks like this <sub>(in subscript)</sub> This is subscript.</p>
        <p>Superscript text looks like this <sup>(in superscript)</sup> This is superscript.</p>
        <h2>Inserted and Deleted</h2>
        <p>Inserted text looks like this: <ins>(in inserted)</ins> This is inserted.</p>
        <p>Deleted text looks like this: <del>(in deleted)</del> This is deleted.</p>
